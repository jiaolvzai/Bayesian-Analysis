Suppose A and B are two binary random variables such that P(A=1,B=1) = .25, P(A=0,B=0)=.25, P(A=1,B=0)=.25, and P(A=0,B=1)=.25. Write a Gibbs sampler to draw 200 samples of (A,B). Do the results approximate the distribution of (A,B)?
Suppose A and B are two binary random variables such that P(A=1,B=1) = .499, P(A=0,B=0)=.499, P(A=1,B=0)=.001, and P(A=0,B=1)=.001. Write a Gibbs sampler to draw 200 samples of (A,B). Do the results approximate the distribution of (A,B)? What might explain any difference from your answer to 3?
Drug A and Drug B are each cholesterol lowering medications. 10 patients took Drug A for a month, and their cholesterol levels were reduced by 11.46, 14.71, 9.52, 10.04, 9.78, 10.32, 9.88, 8.27, 10.07, and 13.62 points. 10 other patients took Drug B, and their cholesterol levels were reduced by 11.00, 10.25, 15.94, 14.10, 12.25, 12.91, 10.67, 12.58, 14.36, and 13.12 points. What is the probability that Drug B is on average more effective than Drug A? What is the 95% HDI for the difference in average effect of Drug B and Drug A? 

 

Step 1: Assume that the Drug A data came from a normal distribution with mean μA and standard deviation σA. Assume that the Drug B data came from a normal distribution with mean μB and standard deviation σB.

 

Step 2: Assign identical independent normal prior distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 100 to μA and μB. Assign identical independent uniform [0,10] priors to σA and σB. (These priors are very wide and reflect little prior information about the parameters.)

 

Step 3: Use JAGS to draw samples from the joint posterior distribution of μA and μB.
