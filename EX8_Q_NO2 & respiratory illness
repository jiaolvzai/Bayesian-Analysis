A study was conducted to explore the association between levels of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and respiratory illness in children. For a sample of children, investigators measured the NO2 levels in their bedrooms and recorded whether they had respiratory illness. The data were as follows:

z=10	z=30	z=50
y=1	21	20	15
y=0	27	14	6
where y indicates respiratory illness and z indicates measured NO2 level. For example, the 21 in the cell corresponding to y=1 and z=10 means that there were 21 children with respiratory illness and measured NO2 level equal to 10.

1. Fit the model:

logit(p(y=1|z))=α+βz.

Report summaries of the posteriors of α and β.

 

2. NO2 levels were measured with a course instrument (i.e. there is measurement error). Let x denote the (unobserved) true NO2 level. Suppose that from a previous calibration study we have the following model for the true NO2 level x as a function of the measured level z:

x∼N(a+bz,σ.meas)

where a=4.48, b=.76, and σ.meas^2=81.14.

Find the posterior of γ and λ in the model

logit(p(y=1|x))=γ+λx.

Compare the posterior ofλ to the posterior of β from question 1.
